**Exploratory notebooks and digital studies by Sean Gibson**  
Understanding the digital world through **mathematics**, **language**, and **perception**.

---

## Overview

This repository is an ongoing collection of notebooks that explore how the digital world works —  
not as code alone, but as **pattern**, **structure**, and **interpretation**.

Each notebook is an act of exploration of how digital systems operate, represtend through visuals, data and mathematical interpretation.  
**visuals**, **sound**, and **mathematical insight**.  
The aim isn’t formal research but to *clarify throguh experimentation*,  
revealting how abstract computation takes shape.

## Current Exploration

### [Fourier Was All You Needed →](https://github.com/stillsmallstudio/public/blob/main/Fourier%20Was%20All%20You%20Needed/Fourier%20Was%20All%20You%20Needed.ipynb)
**Theme:** The union of mathematics, music, and meaning.  
This notebook turns Transformer architecture mathematics into harmonic sound and rhythmic imagery —  
showing how Joseph Fourier’s 19th-century ideas about waves still pulse beneath modern AI.

> It’s a study in how **order**, **frequency**, and **meaning** intertwine —  
> a way to *hear* the geometry that helps machines understand language.

Generates expressive **MIDI outputs**, including:
- `Fourier_Was_All_You_Needed.mid` — harmonic positional encodings  
- `BERTBeats.mid` — semantic motion and meaning in sound

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Interactive visualizations** of how models represent structure  
- **Mathematical storytelling** — from Fourier waves to attention patterns  
- **Creative code experiments** that blend analysis, art, and intuition  
- **Readable commentary** that makes complex ideas approachable  

Each project stands alone, but together they form a growing library of **insight through exploration**.
